              Client Report:
              As a client answer the following questions:
            </h4>
            <p>
              How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan? I decided to use the project for my CSE 111 class, that way if given the chance, I can embed the CSE project into the website, turning it into an interactive site for beginner artists. This way, the artists can learn how to draw, paint, and use the other various art forms without paying for a masterclass without accountability from the instructor. I am planning to expand this to have a small AI model added to use for data collection, and to supervise the code. 
              How did you communicate with your developer? In the beginning, we made sure to communicate, after that it fell off.
              Was there any issues with communication? Not really.
              Did your developer meet your expectations for your site? I have not seen the site yet, so I cannot say.
              What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you? I would check in with them more often, and be better at following through.
              Include a link to the site. N/A

            </h4>
            <p>
              How did you manage your development team and communicate the tasks for your junior devs? I got the site-plan, then created the pages. I could have been better at delegating. Though, no issues with communication.
              How did you communicate with your client? I spoke to them and emailed.
              Was there any issues? I made sure to try and communicate with the client. No issue, just lack of initiative.
              How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client? At first it was confusing, and difficult. But with practice it became easier.
              How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub? So far, it was good, wasn't super hard or demanding.

            <p>
              How did you communicate with your team lead? Not great, I could have tried harder.
              Was there any issues? No, just lack of initiative.
              Did you know what was expected of you for each site? Yes, I understood what was required when the particular page was assigned. It made it easier to work on the site. 
              Were you able to contribute to your sites? Yes, I did by making the Client Report and the page assigned to me.
              Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites? Not really, or if I did, I made sure to troubleshoot it.
